# Visual Thinking Lens – Roadmap

_Last updated: July 30, 2025_

This file outlines the **planned direction** of the Visual Thinking Lens (VTL) project.  
VTL is stable as a research framework but continues to evolve in how it is documented, demonstrated, and shared.

---

## ✅ Current Release (v0.1 – Research Drop)

This repository includes:
- Conceptual briefs and whitepapers explaining core theory
- Watermarked case studies showing recursive critique in action
- Legal and usage restrictions to protect interpretive artifacts

The core **Sketcher Lens engine** and internal scoring logic are **not released**.

---

## 🔄 Planned Additions

These items are under consideration for future publication:

- **Prompt Collapse Suite (Observation Map)**  
  Visual diagrams tracing symbolic degradation and recursive loop behavior.

- **RIDP Engine Case Studies**  
  Reverse Image Decomposition Protocol walkthroughs showing collapse → repair cycles.

- **Expanded Figure Stability Study**  
  More long-run constraint tests beyond the "Thirty Figures" set.

- **Validator Crosswalk (High-Level Overview)**  
  Conceptual map of validators (Prompt Pressure, Compositional Predictability, etc.) without revealing implementation details.

- **Marrowline Protocol Primer**  
  Introductory document on symbolic rupture and refusal logic.

---

## 🚫 Will Not Be Added

- Raw prompt strings, model-specific recipes, or scoring formulas
- Executable code for the Sketcher Lens or related engines
- Unwatermarked images or assets for external reuse

---

## 📌 Guiding Principles

- **Consequence over exposure:** Publish what demonstrates recursive visual intelligence, not what replicates the engine.
- **Research utility first:** Focus on clarity for LLM alignment researchers and artists.
- **Protective publishing:** Maintain strict watermarking and licensing to prevent misuse.
