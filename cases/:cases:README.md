# Cases 
**Visual Thinking Lens**

This folder contains **evidence-based research artifacts** showing the Visual Thinking Lens in action.  \
Each case study documents how generative images behave under structural constraint, recursive pressure, or symbolic rupture.  \
All files are **watermarked PDFs** and protected from reuse or dataset inclusion.\

## 
Included Case Studies

- **Opportunity Mapping: Pressure, Not Perfection**  \ Maps where images invite expansion or recursion under constraint, without intervention. [PDF](case-opportunity-mapping.pdf)
\
- **Where the Mark Begins Tonal Hierarchy Precedes Expressive Surface**  \ Shows why tonal structure is a precondition for meaningful markmaking in generative imagery. [PDF](case-where-the-mark-begins.pdf)
\
- **Engine Contrast: Same Prompt, Different Collapse**  \ Compares how multiple engines respond to identical prompts, exposing different structural failure modes. [PDF](case-engine-contrast.pdf)
\
- **Symbolic Recursion Marrowline Critique: Refusal as Structure**  \ Demonstrates how absence, echo, and refusal become meaning under recursive critique. [PDF](case-symbolic-recursion.pdf)
\
- **Recursive Prompt Design: Architectural Recursion Instead of Style Tweaks**  \ When critique itself becomes the next prompt, restructuring composition rather than decoration. [PDF](case-recursive-prompt-design.pdf)
\
- **Constraint Gravity: Thirty Figures Without Collapse**  \ Tests machine restraint and figure stability across thirty recursive generations. [PDF](case-constraint-gravity-thirty-figures.pdf)
\
- **Soft Collapse Rebuilding Through Recursive Pressure**  \ Shows how a failing image regains structure through tension, not surface changes. [PDF](case-soft-collapse.pdf)
\
- **Concert Score: A Single Image Under Recursive Walkthrough**  \ A full-step trace of one image under the Sketcher Lens, documenting how structural strain is revealed and scored. [PDF](case-concert-score.pdf)
