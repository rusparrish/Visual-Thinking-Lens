## Guidelines

- **Read-Only Repository**  
  This system is closed to contributions to preserve its structural integrity and authorship chain. Forks are permitted for private or academic reference only.

- **No Feature Requests**  
  This is not an open-source toolkit or software package. It is a recursive critique framework and artifact archive.

- **No Issue Tracker Use for Edits**  
  Please do not submit corrections or editorial suggestions via issues. Direct contact is preferred for inquiry or citation:

## Why This Policy?

The Visual Thinking Lens operates as a recursive reasoning system, not a collaborative development project.  
Its scoring systems, critique structures, and internal validators are tightly interwoven. Public contributions would compromise the integrity of the critique logic and recursive scaffolding.
