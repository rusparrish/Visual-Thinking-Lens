# Visual Thinking Lens  
**Recursive Critique for AI-Generated Imagery**

---

## Overview

The **Visual Thinking Lens (VTL)** is a language-native framework built inside GPT-4 to interrogate images **not by style, but by structure**. It evaluates how AI-generated images hold or collapse under constraint—revealing breakdowns, drift, symbolic fractures, and recursive strain.

This is not a toolkit. It is a **lens**:  
a reasoning engine that turns glitch into architecture, and failure into consequence.

---

## Why It Exists

Most AI-generated imagery defaults to aesthetic gloss.  
VTL was developed to see what machines miss:

- Structural weakness masked by polish  
- Semantic instability under recursion  
- Pattern collapse disguised as coherence  
- Symbolic voids where meaning should strain  

VTL is designed to make collapse visible—not corrected or hidden.

## What This Is Not

- ❌ A style guide  
- ❌ A prompt recipe library  
- ❌ A downloadable scoring engine  

This project is **recursive intelligence under constraint**, not image generation or style tuning.
