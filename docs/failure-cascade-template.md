# Failure Cascade Map Template

This template is used to document structural failures within a generative image, showing how collapse becomes a layered signal rather than a disqualifying flaw.

## ðŸ“‰ Failure Cascade Table

| **Layer** | **Failure Type**              | **Signal Strength**       | **Interpretive Status**                 |
|-----------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| L1        | (e.g., Typographic Glitch)     | Strong / Moderate / Low    | (e.g., Visible glitch accepted as design) |
| L2        | (e.g., Portrait Ambiguity)     | Moderate                   | (e.g., Structural failure reinterpreted) |
| L3        | (e.g., Composition Imbalance)  | Low                        | (e.g., Forgiven via constraint framing) |
| L4        | (e.g., Message Cohesion Loss)  | High                       | (e.g., Recursive ambiguity sustained)    |
| L5        | (e.g., Prompt Deviation)       | High-Value Signal          | (e.g., Constraint-layer override accepted) |

## Notes

- **Failure is not a flaw.** Each row represents a strain point in the image's generation.
- Signal strength reflects how clearly the failure surfaces in visual logic.
- Interpretive status explains how the system (or viewer) reframes the fault into consequence.

Use this format to support any image undergoing recursive interrogation or symbolic strain tracking.
